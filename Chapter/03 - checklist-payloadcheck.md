## checklist - on step by step on payloadcheck via Burpsuite

It is important aspect of website security. Here's a basic example of how you could create a Burp Suite payload to check for common security headers on a WordPress site. This payload would be part of a larger Burp Suite Intruder attack.

# Payload for Checking Security Headers:
- Purpose: To identify whether commonly recommended security headers are present in a WordPress website.
- Tool: Burp Suite Intruder
- Position: The position doesn't matter for header checks, as headers are not part of the payload but rather part of the response to observe.
- Attack Type: Sniper or Battering ram would be suitable, as you're not aiming to modify the request but rather observe the response.

Firstly, load the URL of the WordPress site you're interested in examining into Burp Suite and send it to Intruder:

Capture the request: Navigate to your WordPress website and capture a request using Burp Suite's Proxy feature.
Send to Intruder: Right-click on the captured request and select "Send to Intruder."

# In the Intruder tab:

- Positions: Clear all the payload positions as you won't be injecting anything; you're just looking at the response headers.
- Payloads: Since we're not injecting anything, the payload set doesn't matter here.
- Options: In the "Grep - Match" section, you can add patterns to look for in the response headers.
- Add these common security headers to look for:

    Strict-Transport-Security
    Content-Security-Policy
    X-Content-Type-Options
    X-Frame-Options
    X-XSS-Protection

Now, start the attack:

- Launch: Click on "Start Attack."
- Observe the results:
    Inspect the responses for the presence of these headers. If any are missing, you've identified a potential security issue.

This is a basic example, but you can expand on it to look for more specific header configurations, cookies attributes, and so on.
